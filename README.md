# wpsplit
Python Script by [eerac](https://wordpress.org/support/profile/eerac) to split WordPress export WXR file into smaller segments for importing.
Updated by Lon Koenig to use regular expressions so it works in more cases.

Syntax:
{path_to}wpsplit.py {wordpress export file.xml} {number of files to split into}
